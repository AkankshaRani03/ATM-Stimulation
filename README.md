# ATM-Stimulation
<h3>Overview</h3>
The ATM Simulation System is designed to replicate the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Java. The system incorporates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, which allows users to perform standard banking transactions such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, fund transfers, and account management.
The system emphasizes providing a secure, user-friendly experience while maintaining flexibility for future expansion, such as integrating additional banking services and advanced security measures. This project focuses on creating a seamless and efficient ATM experience through a combination of secure authentication, reliable transaction processing, and an interactive interface.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<strong>System Architecture</strong>
Frontend:</strong> Java Swing Framework for GUI design, providing an intuitive and interactive interface.
Backend:</strong> Java Core for handling business logic, account management, transaction processing, and data storage.
Design Pattern:</strong> Model-View-Controller (MVC) to ensure clear separation of concerns, making the system scalable and maintainable.


<strong>User Interface Development</strong>
CardLayout is used to manage different screens, including login, main menu, and transaction screens.
GridBagLayout is employed for efficient placement of UI components, ensuring responsiveness and alignment.
Custom theming and hover effects enhance the user experience by providing a modern and visually appealing interface.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<strong>1. User Interface Development</strong>
Java Swing was used to create a responsive and interactive GUI.
CardLayout was used for screen navigation (e.g., login, main menu, transactions).
GridBagLayout arranged UI components flexibly.
Interactive buttons with hover effects and tooltips were added to enhance user experience.

<strong>2. Core Functionality</strong>

<strong>Account Management:</strong> Users can create, view, and manage accounts with secure PIN protection.
<strong>Transactions:</strong> Includes balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and fund transfers. Each transaction updates the account balance.
<strong>Transaction History:</strong> Users can view a log of their past transactions.
<strong>Receipt Generation:</strong> A receipt is generated after each transaction.

<h3>Results</h3>
Functional Features

<strong>User Authentication:</strong> Secure login system requiring PIN input.
<strong>Account Creation:</strong> Functionality to create new accounts.
<strong>Balance Inquiry:</strong> Users can check their account balance.
<strong>Cash Withdrawal:</strong> Allows users to withdraw money from their accounts.
<strong>Cash Deposit:</strong> Supports depositing funds into accounts.
<strong>Fund Transfer:</strong> Users can transfer funds between accounts.
<strong>PIN Change:</strong> Functionality to change user PIN.
<strong>Transaction History:</strong> Users can view their transaction history.
<strong>Receipt Generation:</strong> Automatically generates receipts for transactions.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
        The project successfully implemented core ATM functionalities, including user authentication, transaction processing, and account management.The system provides a secure, user-friendly interface, making it suitable for simulating real-world ATM operations.Robust error handling and security measures ensure safe and reliable transactions.
